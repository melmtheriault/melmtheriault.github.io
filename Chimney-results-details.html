							<h3>Context</h3>
							<p>Chimney wants to be known as a place where you can find your dream home in a matter of minutes with the help of AI-powered recommendations based on buyers’ preferences and priorities. </p>

								<p>For our MVP, the team wanted to build the foundations of the search process, namely, the results & property listings page. We wanted to show the most relevant neighbourhoods to the user and entice the user to click on the listing. Once on the listing, we wanted to present the main insights that are relevant to the user for the properties they browse in detail. With little time and resources to reach a MVP, I spent most of my time doing secondary research and iterating to design a version we could test with users. </p>

							<h3>Design Activities Part 1: Secondary Research</h3>
								<p>The real estate space was new to me, so I took time to study best practices and existing patterns on competitors websites and accomodation booking websites alike. I extended my research to websites that serve different types of recommendations or have a match system to understand how that type of information is translated to users.   </p>

								<h3>Design Activities Part 2: Iterative Wireframing</h3>
									<p>We went through several iterations of mid to high-fidelity wireframes for both the results and property details page.</p>

								<h3>Outcome</h3>
								<p>Listed results that are ranked for the user and lets them know how well a neighbourhood matches their preferences input during onboarding.</p>

			<h3>Next steps & Reflection</h3>
			<p>As the foundations for our MVP have been designed and implimented by our stellar engineers, next step is to complete the onboarding flow for users as well as the map user experience to have a product we can test with real users. Our MVP is set to go live mid March 2021, so you can expect an update on this case study soon!</p>
			
			<p>On the design side, this was my first time working with a design system. Our Design lead starting building out the design system mid way through my design process and though I was tempted to create custom elements by force of habit, I was SO happy to start reusing and recycling our existing patterns. It was great to standardize everything and was fun to learn how to add to the system too.</p>
